Bundesbank council member Lothar
Mueller said the bank has not given up its money supply policy
and that restraining money supply growth does not always mean
pushing up interest rates.
    Mueller said in an article for the Boersen Zeitung
financial daily that a monetary policy which took into account
exchange rate expectations and capital flows could not be
confused with an exchange rate oriented policy.
    The article followed international press speculation that
the Bundesbank had abandoned money supply targetting in favour
of an exchange rate policy.
