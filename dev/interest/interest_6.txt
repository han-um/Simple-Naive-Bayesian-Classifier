British bank base lending rates are
likely to fall by as much as one full point to 9-1/2 pct this
week following the sharp three billion stg cut in the U.K.
Central government borrowing target to four billion stg set in
today's 1987 budget, bank analysts said.
    The analysts described Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson's budget as cautious, a quality which currency and money
markets had already started to reward.
    Sterling surged on foreign exchange markets and money
market interest rates moved sharply lower as news of the budget
measures came through, the analysts said.
    Lloyds merchant bank chief economist Roger Bootle said he
expected base rates to be cut by one full point tomorrow.
    "This is very much a safety-first budget in order to get
interest rates down," he said.
